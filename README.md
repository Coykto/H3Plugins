# H3Plugins - Plugins for Heroes of Might and Magic III using the H3API headers.

Welcome to the home of the Heroes of Might and Magic III **H3API** headers and plugins made using them. This repository will also be used to distribute the **SoD_SP** plugin which is coded using the same headers.



## Download Releases

Releases are available here (TODO).

## Obtaining and using the H3API Headers

A release for the headers might be updated from time to time, however your best bet is to clone them directly.
In order to use the headers, add the headers to a folder of your choice and then add this line:
> #include "{_...relativepath..._}/H3API.h"

The H3API headers were successfully tested using the 2013, 2015 and 2017 versions of MSVC.

## Build Instructions

All necessary files for building using _Visual Studio_ are available in the repository. Upon cloning the directory, you should be able to build the included projects yourself.
